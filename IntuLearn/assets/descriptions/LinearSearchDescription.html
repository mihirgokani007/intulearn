        <strong>Linear search</strong> or <strong>sequential 
        search</strong> is a method for finding 
        a particular value in a list, that consists of <u>checking 
        every one of its elements, one at a time and in sequence, 
        until the desired one is found</u>. Linear search is the simplest 
        search algorithm; it is a special case of brute-force search.

        For a list with n items, the best case is when the value is 
        equal to the first element of the list, in which case only 
        one comparison is needed. The worst case is when the value 
        is not in the list (or occurs only once at the end of the 
        list), in which case n comparisons are needed.
        Its worst case cost is proportional to the number of elements 
        in the list; and so is its expected cost, if all list elements 
        are equally likely to be searched for.
