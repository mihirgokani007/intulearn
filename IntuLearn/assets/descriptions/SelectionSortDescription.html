        <strong>Selection sort</strong> is an in-place comparison sort. 
        It has O(n^2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists,
        and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.
        However, selection sort is noted for its simplicity.

        <p>
        The working of selection sort somewhat resembles insertion sort. An input array is 
        imaginary divided into two parts - sorted one and unsorted one. At the beginning, 
        sorted part is empty and unsorted one contains the whole array. At every step, 
        it finds the minimum (or maximum, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted part and appends
        it to the end of the sorted one. When unsorted part becomes empty, algorithm stops.

        Selection sort stops, when unsorted part becomes empty. As we know, on every step number of 
        unsorted elements decreased by one. Therefore, selection sort makes n steps (n is number of elements in array), before stop. 
        Also, every step requires finding minimum in unsorted part. Summing up, n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1, results in O(n^2) 
        number of comparisons, in any case. Number of swaps may vary from zero (in case of sorted array) to 
        n - 1 (in case array was sorted in reversed order), which results in O(n) number of swaps. 
        So, the overall algorithm complexity is O(n^2).
