        If we have some already sorted elements, a new unsorted element 
        can be inserted in the sorted set in proper place, making it a 
        part of sorted set, which is the main idea behind <strong>Insertion Sort</strong>. 
        It is the simple example of the <u>incremental insertion technique</u>, 
        where we build up a complicated structure on n items by first building 
        it on n - 1 items and then making the necessary changes to fix things 
        by adding a new item.

        Insertion sort algorithm somewhat resembles selection sort. An input array is 
        imaginary divided into two parts - sorted one and unsorted one. At the beginning, 
        sorted part contains the first element of the array and unsorted one contains the rest. 
        At every step, algorithm takes first element in the unsorted part and inserts 
        it to the right place of the sorted one. When unsorted part becomes empty, algorithm stops.

        The best case input is the input array that is already sorted. 
        In each iteration, the first element of the unsorted section 
        is only compared with the right-most element of the sorted section.
        Hence, in this case it has a linear running time (i.e., O(n)). 
        The worst case is when the input array is already sorted in reverse order.
        Here, in each iteration, each element of the unsorted section 
        needs to be compared and shifted with all elements of sorted section. 
        This gives insertion sort a quadratic running time (i.e., O(n^2)). 
        The average case for this algorithm is also quadratic.

        <li><b>Adaptive</b>: Its performance adapts to the initial order of elements. So it takes only O(n) time when elements are already sorted.</li>
