        <strong>Selection sort</strong> is a sorting algorithm, 
        specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n^2) 
        time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists.
        The algorithm divides the input list into two parts:
        <ul> 
        <li>the sublist of items already sorted, which is built up 
        from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and</li> 
        <li>the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list</li>
        </ul>
        Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted 
        sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds 
        by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting 
        order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging it with 
        the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), 
        and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

        Selection sort is not difficult to analyze compared to 
        other sorting algorithms since none of the loops depend 
        on the data in the array. Selecting the lowest element 
        requires scanning all n elements (this takes n ? 1 comparisons) 
        and then swapping it into the first position. Finding the 
        next lowest element requires scanning the remaining n ? 1 
        elements and so on, for (n ? 1) + (n ? 2) + ... + 2 + 1 = 
        n(n ? 1) / 2 ? ?(n2) comparisons (see arithmetic progression). 
        Each of these scans requires one swap for n ? 1 elements (the 
        final element is already in place).
