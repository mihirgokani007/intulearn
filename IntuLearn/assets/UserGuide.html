		    The very first screen is the splash screen which shows logo of this app.
		    The next screen is the main screen which enlists all available units 
		    along with the author name and a skill level icon to learn that unit.
		    You can easily filter the units by name, category, and author name 
		    using the search button. Following list shows all possible skill levels:
		    <table id="table-skill-levels">
	        <tr><td><img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_atom_1.png" alt="Basic" /></td><td>Basic Skills</td></tr>
	        <tr><td><img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_atom_2.png" alt="Moderate" /></td><td>Moderate Skills</td></tr>
	        <tr><td><img src="file:///android_res/drawable/ic_atom_3.png" alt="Advanced" /></td><td>Advanced Skills</td></tr>
		    </table>

        <section>
		    <a name="unit-details"><h3>The Unit Details</h3></a>
            Each unit is divided in 3 sections, namely, <b>Description</b>, 
            <b>Experiment</b> an <b>Evaluate</b>. In order to move 
            between sections, select the appropreate tab at the top 
            of the screen or simply touch the screen with your finger 
            and slide it sideways for the next tab to appear.
		    
		    <ul>
		    <li><a name="unit-details-1"><b>Description:</b></a> 
		        This tab contains a brief description of the 
		        algorithm. It also contains some good references 
		        that you must follow to get reasonable knowledge 
		        for the perticular topic. After all, self-learning 
		        is the motto of this app!</li>
		    <li><a name="unit-details-2"><b>Experiment:</b></a> 
		        In this tab you can try out some animated examples. 
		        The animation starts after touching the play botton 
		        on the bottom right corner of the screen. It can be 
		        paused or replayed using the same button. In order 
		        to modify the input to the algorithm, simply long 
		        press on the input elements and a dialog box will 
		        appear to take your input. Note that you can only 
		        modify input when the animation is not running.</li>
		    <li><a name="unit-details-3"><b>Evaluate:</b></a> 
		        This section contains a set of contains multiple 
		        choice questions to test your learning and skills.
		        Your time to complete the quiz will be shown to you
		        when you press the Stop button. You can also pause 
		        the quiz by pressing Pause button. The correct 
		        answers with explanation is put on our website.
		        But, we highly recommend you to first try to attempt 
		        entire quiz yourself, there's no harm if you get 
		        couple of answers wrong!</li>
